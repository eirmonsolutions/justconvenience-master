Such factors for delivery failure may include (but are not limited to), you not coming to the door when delivery arrives and/or not responding to the delivery driver/store using contact information you have provided us and failing to provide access within a reasonable amount of time, and the delivery driver is unable to find a safe location to leave the order.<br><br> 
An order may also fail, as detailed above if the driver refuses to deliver to you because of Age related concerns, where the product being delivered is Alcohol, Tobacco or some other age restricted item.
